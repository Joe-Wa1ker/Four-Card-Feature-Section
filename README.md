## My process

- Wrote outline of HTML and CSS on paper, this helps me to consider what is needed before I start coding
- Wrote mark-up and added styles using a mobile-first workflow
- Added media queries to display different layouts with breakpoints at 820 and 1111px (I added a third layout for between 820 and 1110px because neither of the two designs provided by FM looked right within that range)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- CSS Grid, this was my first use

### Continued development

- Need more practise with grid layouts
- Need to learn more about scalable typography and how to optimise for it
- Improve with use of box-shadow
